# Need Some Space

You are a member of the crew of the Starship Infallible. You've just come out of a warp tunnel - it was a harsh battle, and your friends were among the casualties. The ship you're on is badly damaged. With your now-skeleton crew, are you able to complete repairs and survive until your rescue beacon is answered?

## About

When the Garry's Mod GCC 2017 came around, I made this gamemode for it. After getting it to a nearly complete state, playtesting found it to be not very fun/too boring/too confusing. However, the code's still here if anyone's interested.

## Installation

Checkout this repository to `garrysmod/garrysmod/gamemodes`.

## Maps

`nss_*` maps by default have the ability to function with NSS. No setup required!

For maps not designed for use with NSS, players with the `superadmin` rank can press Q to open the map editor. Instructions will be displayed ingame.
