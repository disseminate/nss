			<p>You are a member of the crew of the Starship Infallible. You've just come out of a warp tunnel - it was a harsh battle, and you had many casualties. The ship is badly damaged. With your now-skeleton crew, are you able to complete repairs and survive until your rescue beacon is answered?</p>
			<p>In this gamemode, the map is falling apart, and you (or some of your crew) has to fix it. Every few seconds, something will go wrong, and someone has to get to a terminal or machine and repair it via a small minigame or action event. Repair too few things in time, and your ship takes damage (and also affects gameplay). Take enough damage, and the round ends with the ship's annihilation.</p>
